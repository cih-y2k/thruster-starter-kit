# Fanta Starter Kit

Welcome to the [fanta](https://github.com/trezm/fanta) starter kit. It includes the basic layout of an app, including a subroute. To start, simply clone this repo and run

```bash
> cargo run
```

And that's it! The available endpoints will be:
- `GET /plaintext`: will return a `Hello, World!` response in plaintext
- `GET /json`: will return a `{ message: "Hello, World!" }` response in JSON
- `GET /ping`: will return a `pong` response
